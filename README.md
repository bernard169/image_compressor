# Image compressor
This project is part of an introduction course to golang programming.

Use the Huffman coding to compress images. A description of the algorithm can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

The point of this project is to take advantage of the ease of multithreading in goland.
